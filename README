This software was implemented to calculate the optimal phase distribution for parallel MRI acquisitions reconstructed by
Virtual Coil GRAPPA as well as to design appropriate RF pulses to introduce the optimal phase. This software is intended for
research and educational use only and not suitable for diagnostig use. No warranties are given. (see LICENSE for details).

2. Installation and usage
=========================

Prerequisites:
- Windows operating system (tested on 7 and 10). The software may also work with other OS but not tested.
- Matlab R2015a or newer version. The software may also work with older version but not tested.
- Parallel Computing Toolbox for Matlab

Intallation:
- Just download the whole package. all pathways and dependencies are defined within the used functions.


Structure and file format:
The three folders contain three separate parts:

sample_data: sample datasets used in the manuscript (see References) .mat files that can be loaded directly into Matlab.
both files contain two k-space dataset as Matlab matrices. Dimension order is [PE, read, channel] in these datasets.
One .mat file contains two k-space data: one measured with conventional excitation (kspace_conv), and one measured with
tailored excitation to introduce the optimal object phase for in-plane acceleration factor 8 in the given setup (kspace_opt).
SE-EPI_rawdata.mat contains data that was measured with a segmented SE-EPI, while T1wSE_rawdata.mat contains data measured with
T1-weighted simple spin-echo.



reconstruction: sample code for VCC reconstruction.

sample_recon_code.m: sample script to simulate acceleration using the sample datasets, and perform standard GRAPPA 
and VCC-GRAPPA reconstruction. Should run "as is", with no further settings. However, number of ACS lines and some other 
parameters can be set differently by the user.

VCC_signal_creation.m: script for creating virtual coil signals, that could be used with any further reconstruction, e.g. VCC-GRAPPA. 

grappa.m:  This is a teaching version of the GRAPPA reconstruction code for simple Cartesian acquisitions with constant
undersampling density. This program uses a simple 2x9 kernel (tested for af=8) to reconstruct each missing point and uses
a cyclic boundary assumption at the edges of k-space. The ACS lines used for reconstruction are NOT included in the final
reconstructed dataset. g-factor maps are also calculated from reconstruction kernels. 
Note that, this a simple, non-iterative GRAPPA, in contrast to the iterative GRAPPA used in the manuscript, which could not be
made public due to copyright. However, the extension of this GRAPPA code  to iterative GRAPPA is quite straightforward based
on the appropriate iGRAPPA paper (see T. Zhao et al. Magn Reson Med. 2008;59(4):903–907)

phase_calculation: this folder contains the functions to calculate the optimal phase distributions for VCC-GRAPPA reconstruction
based on a full prescan, and to design an appropriate RF pulse to introduce the optimal phase map; as they were used in the manuscript.

OptimizedPhasePulseDesign2DSpiral.m: the main script that should run "as is" without further settings; however, there are some
parameters that can be changed by the user. It loads the sample data and spiral gradient waveform, and calls the other functions
to calculate optimal phase pattern and to design the RF pulse.

optimal_phase_calculation.m: the code for calculating the optimal phase for a given acceleration factor in the given setup, 
using a derivative-free simplex search.

PhaseStepsMinimize.m: calculating the norm of phase gradient after separate phase shifts are added to overlapping voxels, 
without the modification of SENSE g-factors. Used to search for a spatially smooth optimal phase map.

gfactor.m: calculating SENSE g-factors based on coil sensitivity maps for a given overlapping voxel group.

g_factor_cov_fun.m: calculating sum of squared VCC-SENSE g-factors based on coil sensitivity maps and object phase values
of the overlapping voxel group. Used as a penalty function in the calculation of the optimal phase distribution.

gradient_waveform.mat: predefined gradient waveforms for spiral trajectories.

cMapEspirit.m: script to call the Matlab implementation of the ESPIRiT algorithm (original algorithm by Martin Uecker and 
Michael Lustig, see M. Uecker et al. Magn Reson Med. 2014;71(3):990–1001)

ESPIRiT folder: Matlab implementation and helping functions for ESPIRiT.

# phase-optimization-for-VCC

This MATLAB code is written to compute optimal phase distribution for Virtual Conjugate Coil reconstruction of accelerated MRI, and also to design an RF pulse to introdude the calculated phase.

Theory of the phase calculation and pulse design is described in the associated manuscript submitted to MRM:
